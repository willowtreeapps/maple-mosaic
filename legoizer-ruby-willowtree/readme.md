## Legoizer
This is a simple little Ruby script that takes in an image and uses it to generate a Lego blueprint.

It's paired with Brickfair VA's Mosaic Instructions and is specifically for a subset of Lego colors (documented in the parent readme).

## Usage:

``` sh
ruby legoizer.rb <path-to-image> <block-width> <draw-outlines>
```

e.g.
```
ruby legoizer.rb the_orca.jpg 1 false
```
